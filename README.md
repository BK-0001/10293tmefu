# Assignment - Fake Store to TypeScript

## Description

In this assignment, you will need to convert the mid term (Fake Store) to TypeScript.

You have the option to use the code provided or to use your own code.

However, you need to use OOP, converting the classes for each entity created.

## Objectives

- The main objective is to convert the project to TypeScript
- Make all the necessaries changes to the code.
- Create Interfaces and Types when necessary.

## Instructions and Requirements

### Entities (classes)

The code provided has the follow Entities (classes)

- Cart
- CartItem
- CartItemList
- Header
- ProductItem
- ProductList
- Shop
- App
- Index.js
- Component.js

### Step 1 - Review the code to understand the functionality.

Revisit the steps provided in the MidTerm if you have any questions.

### Step 2 - Install the dependencies of the project using the install command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3 - Install and initialize the TypeScript and make the necessaries changes to the tsconfig.json

Use the command bellow to install the TypeScript dependency:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

To initialize the TypeScript and create the tsconfig.json, initialize the TypeScript with the follow command:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

Change the Compiler Options of the tsconfig.json to choose the root directory (where the .ts files are - "rootDir") and the output directory (where the .js files will be generated -"outDir").

### Step 4 - Start your assignment

You can just change the extension of the file to .ts and start making the necessary changes or you can create a new folder with the .ts files.

However, remember always to choose the correct path in the tsconfig.json to compile successfully.
